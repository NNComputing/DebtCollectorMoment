# DebtCollectorMoment
Suppose you have a friend who borrows money and asks you to keep track of how much money they borrowed. In that case, you can use this debt calculator made using elementary Python programming to calculate how much money they owe you based on different products' fixed prices. I decided to make this code because I was bored and because my friend owed me money.
